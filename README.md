## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course presents fundamentals of Python programming language for data intensive applications and decision making. The course formally introduces industry level tools for the best practices of software engineering using Python. Such tools find applicability in many engineering application areas, including data science, machine learning, communications systems, embedded systems, smart grids, robotics, Internet, and enterprise  networks, or any network where information flows and alters decision making.

## STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES
After successful completion of this course, students will be able to
*	program basic algorithms in Python,
*	extract and analyze data in Python,
*	prepare for their future career in Technology related fields.

## FORMAT AND STRUCTURE
*	The classes will include dynamic illustrations of the concepts. Students are expected to bring their laptops and run the programs in their own laptops.
*	There will be weekly coding or handwritten assignments. The students will return coding assignments via github which will be tested using continuous integration tool Travis-CI.

## COURSE MATERIALS
* Textbook(s): 		Learning Python (5E) by Mark Lutz
* Other Readings: 	How to think like a Computer Scientist by Downey, Elkner, Meyers
* Materials:	 	Canvas will be used for sharing assignment links and grades

## COURSE REQUIREMENTS
* **Attendance:**	Attendance is crucial for an effective learning but will not be graded. 
* **Homework:** 	Coding assignments will be submitted via github and graded and tested in the cloud. Handwritten assignments will be returned at the beginning of a class.
* **Project:**	Students are expected to finish a project that is documented in their github repository. 
* **Exams:** 	There will be a single final hand-written exam.

## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY 

### Graduate Student Code of Academic Integrity
All Stevens graduate students promise to be fully truthful and avoid dishonesty, fraud, misrepresentation, and deceit of any type in relation to their academic work. A student’s submission of work for academic credit indicates that the work is the student's own. All outside assistance must be acknowledged. Any student who violates this code or who knowingly assists another student in violating this code shall be subject to discipline.

All graduate students are bound to the Graduate Student Code of Academic Integrity by enrollment in graduate coursework at Stevens. It is the responsibility of each graduate student to understand and adhere to the Graduate Student Code of Academic Integrity. More information including types of violations, the process for handling perceived violations, and types of sanctions can be found at www.stevens.edu/provost/graduate-academics. 

### Special Provisions for Undergraduate Students in 500-level Courses 

The general provisions of the Stevens Honor System do not apply fully to graduate courses, 500 level or otherwise. Any student who wishes to report an undergraduate for a violation in a 500-level course shall submit the report to the Honor Board following the protocol for undergraduate courses, and an investigation will be conducted following the same process for an appeal on false accusation described in Section 8.04 of the Bylaws of the Honor System. Any student who wishes to report a graduate student may submit the report to the Dean of Graduate Academics or to the Honor Board, who will refer the report to the Dean. The Honor Board Chairman will give the Dean of Graduate Academics weekly updates on the progress of any casework relating to 500-level courses. For more information about the scope, penalties, and procedures pertaining to undergraduate students in 500-level courses, see Section 9 of the Bylaws of the Honor System document, located on the Honor Board website. 

## EXAM ROOM CONDITIONS
The following procedures apply to quizzes and exams for this course. As the instructor, I reserve the right to modify any conditions set forth below by printing revised Exam Room Conditions on the quiz or exam. 

1.	Students are not permitted to use any electronic devices or text books during quizzes and/or exams. 

2.	Students are/are not allowed to work with or talk to other students during quizzes and/or exams. 

## LEARNING ACCOMODATIONS
Stevens Institute of Technology is dedicated to providing appropriate accommodations to students with documented disabilities. The Office of Disability Services (ODS) works with undergraduate and graduate students with learning disabilities, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorders, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, psychiatric disorders, and other such disabilities in order to help students achieve their academic and personal potential. They facilitate equal access to the educational programs and opportunities offered at Stevens and coordinate reasonable accommodations for eligible students. These services are designed to encourage independence and self-advocacy with support from the ODS staff. The ODS staff will facilitate the provision of accommodations on a case-by-case basis. 
### Disability Services Confidentiality Policy 
Student Disability Files are kept separate from academic files and are stored in a secure location within the Office of Disability Services. The Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g; 34CFR, Part 99) regulates disclosure of disability documentation and records maintained by Stevens Disability Services. According to this act, prior written consent by the student is required before our Disability Services office may release disability documentation or records to anyone. An exception is made in unusual circumstances, such as the case of health and safety emergencies.
For more information about Disability Services and the process to receive accommodations, visit https://www.stevens.edu/office-disability-services. If you have any questions please contact: Phillip Gehman, the Director of Disability Services Coordinator at Stevens Institute of Technology at pgehman@stevens.edu or by phone (201) 216-3748.
## INCLUSIVITY 
### Name and Pronoun Usage 
As this course includes group work and in-class discussion, it is vitally important for us to create an educational environment of inclusion and mutual respect. This includes the ability for all students to have their chosen gender pronoun(s) and chosen name affirmed. If the class roster does not align with your name and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor of the necessary changes. 
### Inclusion Statement
Stevens Institute of Technology believes that diversity and inclusiveness are essential to excellence in academic discourse and innovation. In this class, the perspective of people of all races, ethnicities, gender expressions and gender identities, religions, sexual orientations, disabilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, and nationalities will be respected and viewed as a resource and benefit throughout the semester. Suggestions to further diversify class materials and assignments are encouraged. If any course meetings conflict with your religious events, please do not hesitate to reach out to your instructor to make alternative arrangements.

You are expected to treat your instructor and all other participants in the course with courtesy and respect. Disrespectful conduct and harassing statements will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary actions.
## MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES

While you are at Stevens, there are many resources to promote and support mental health.  The Office of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) offers free and confidential services to all enrolled students who are struggling to cope with personal issues (e.g., difficulty adjusting to college or trouble managing stress) or psychological difficulties (e.g., anxiety and depression).  Appointments are strongly encouraged and can be made by phone (201-216-5177) or in-person (on the 7th floor of the Howe Center). CAPS is open from 9:00 am – 5:00 pm Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays and from 9:00 am – 7:00 pm on Tuesdays during the Fall and Spring semesters.
